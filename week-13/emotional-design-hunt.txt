# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:
I love the Logitech MX Master mouse for many reasons. I love the black color with the gold/copper trim. To me it gives an appealing appearance.

* Behavioral:
But the reason I bought this mouse is because of how it feels in my hands. Its ergonomics are perfect for the shape of my hand and it doesn't have a ton of unnecessary buttons that I will never use.

* Reflective:
I also love this mouse because I trust Logitech. When have you ever heard someone complain about Logitech making a bad mouse or keyboard? Exactly! never! I have never had a bad experience with them and I trust them as a manufacturer for it.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Make the site visually appealing. Will hopefully make the user happy.
2. Know why the site exists and why people will go there for it. Don't add anything unnecessary to the page.
3. Give the user a reason to trust the site redesign. If they trust it they will not doubt it unless a reason is given to them.
