i# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: I chose these colors mainly because these are the colors I use on my Alienware gaming laptop. Blue is my favorite color but I also love having more gray/black included as well because most gaming laptops are black.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: The first color that came to my head when I read "organic foods" was yellow. I really like this color palette for this kind of site because I think it can get the point across without having to use the color green which is used for all "organic" food sites. I picked the redish/brown color as a good contrast to the bright yellow and gold colors.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Explanation of your color choices: The color gold HAS to be on a banking website. It just makes sense to me. I really like the light shades of blues with the gold. I think it fits much better than a full or true dark blue. I like the beige color as well because I think it complements the gold and blue and brings them together in a sense.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.
