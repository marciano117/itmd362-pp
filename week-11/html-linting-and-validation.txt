# Production Problem 6: HTML De-Linting and Validation

## The Problem

Using the HTML Tidy tool, installed as a command-line tool on your computer via instructions at http://www.html-tidy.org, and the HTML validator at http://validator.w3.org, rework the HTML file in this directory (`index.html`) so that is free from errors.

## Resources

* HTML Tidy: http://www.html-tidy.org/
* HTML Validator: http://validator.w3.org/

## Deliverables

1. First, run HTML Tidy on the index.html file. Copy and paste the errors here:

line 6 column 5 - Warning: <meta> unexpected or duplicate quote mark
line 9 column 5 - Error: <figure> is not recognized!
line 9 column 5 - Warning: discarding unexpected <figure>
line 10 column 46 - Warning: <img> attribute with missing trailing quote mark
line 13 column 14 - Warning: replacing invalid character code 128
line 13 column 15 - Warning: replacing invalid character code 153
line 14 column 5 - Warning: discarding unexpected </figure>
line 10 column 7 - Warning: missing </a> before <p>
line 5 column 5 - Warning: <meta> proprietary attribute "charset"
line 5 column 5 - Warning: <meta> lacks "content" attribute
line 7 column 5 - Warning: <link> inserting "type" attribute
line 16 column 5 - Warning: <script> inserting "type" attribute
Info: Document content looks like HTML Proprietary
11 warnings, 1 error were found!

This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

Character codes 128 to 159 (U+0080 to U+009F) are not allowed in HTML;
even if they were, they would likely be unprintable control characters.
Tidy assumed you wanted to refer to a character with the same byte value in the 
specified encoding and replaced that reference with the Unicode equivalent.

2. Fix as many errors as are listed by HTML Tidy, and re-run until there are no errors reported. HINT: Always fix the first error reported, then re-run tidy. Then, run the contents of `index.html` through the HTML validator. List any errors that the validator reports here:

Error: Duplicate ID hank-and-fanny.
From line 12, column 7; to line 12, column 38
re>↩      <figcaption id="hank-and-fanny">↩     
Warning: The first occurrence of ID hank-and-fanny was here.
From line 9, column 5; to line 9, column 76
body>↩    <figure role="img" aria-labelledby="hank-and-fanny" id="hank-and-fanny">↩     
Error: Element figcaption not allowed as child of element body in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)
From line 12, column 7; to line 12, column 38
re>↩      <figcaption id="hank-and-fanny">↩     
Contexts in which element figcaption may be used:
As the first or last child of a figure element.
Content model for element body:
Flow content.
Error: Stray end tag figure.
From line 16, column 5; to line 16, column 13

3. Finally, fix the errors that are listed by the HTML validator, and commit the `index.html` file in its error-free state.

4. Bonus: What error remained that neither Tidy nor the validator did not catch? Fix it, if you've not already, and mark as its own commit.
