# Production Problem 7: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. http://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/taskchecklist.html
2. http://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/navchecklist.html

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1. Site loads and renders quickly.
2. Background color and text color contrasts appropriately.
3. Page is free from unnecessary information.
4. Site structure is simple and optimized.
5. Users can complete common tasks as quick as possible.
6. Site avoids unnecessary registration.
7. User doesn't need to enter the same information twice.
8. Site requires minimum scrolling and clicking.
9. Path for any task is shortened to 2-5 clicks.
10. Any complex tasks should show the user the steps.
